            <div class="div22"><p>Studimeals was a university project we took on with our clients being our teachers. Our stakeholders were students who needed easy-to-make recipes with calculated time estimates and affordable ingredient lists so that individuals with low budgets, little free time or little experience in cooking could still indulge in practising healthier living rather than relying on takeout fast food or microwave meals. We worked from start to finish within 12 weeks. We conducted interviews, user tests, and different methods under the DOT framework and CMD methods. As one of my first client projects it was a great start and I learnt a lot for beginners but it also set the base from which I aimed to build up. Over time from project to project, my work improved greatly and with that advancement, I began receiving real clients for my semester projects.</p></div>

            <div class="div25"><p>This is the product page for one of the many recipes I made for the website. It is not well represented in the picture but on the actual webpage, you can scroll down to find the ingredients, price estimates and instructions. For this project, my group and I opted to use a free license platform such as Pexels to receive stock images to add visual appeal to our recipe pages. Each page of this website went through many levels of prototyping from low fidelity to mid to high with many phases of testing in between for user satisfaction and client approval.</p></div>
            <div class="div26"><p>This is our team, team Studimeals. It consists of Lewis Cardona, Dieuwe Buijink, Kristian Ceders and me, Sina Sharifi. Our group worked quite well even though we did not know each other quite well yet. I like to think I break the ice with new people I meet quite easily so I have no problem getting along with everyone. I find it important for one to carry their weight so whenever I am put in a group I always make sure to do my part, whether I am sick or busy with other work. I prioritise and work based on a schedule to not let anyone down and to complete all my tasks and this has repeatedly been reflected in my work. The group agreed on this mindset and we all decided to make a team charter to present our availability, main skills and weaknesses and what role we think fits us best in the project. </p></div>
