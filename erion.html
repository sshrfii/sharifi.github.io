            <div class="div22"><p>At the beginning of the second semester of my studies, I was grouped up with my peers and we were greeted by our client, Erion Kapaj, an artist/sculptor from Greece. It was a pleasure getting to know Mr Kapaj and interviewing him. He was a very unique client as he was an artist and a mathematician and so he wanted something abstract and mind-boggling yet simple. Quite literally when we asked him our research question to better understand his preferences, we were given the answers “I’m not sure” and “Maybe” which is difficult when trying to build a platform in favour of our client, but the challenge was great for experience and working around a scenario this early is great training for more professional settings where decisions are more vitally important. Our solution to this was to ask him certain questions to push him to give answers. </p></div>

            <div class="div24"><img src="erionkapaj.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="div25"><p>This is the final product we created for him through a multitude of iterations, prototypes, interviews, user tests, public interviews and more. The home page showcases his work and brief descriptions of them. The About page has a picture you can see of him on the boat with his son and a personal description of him, his interests, goals, and more about his passion. The shop page contains his art that is for sale with their prices. As per his request once you click on the art piece you can be directed to Saachi where you can find his contact info to negotiate the purchase of a piece with him. Overall, our group, Issos, did quite well and our teachers were pleased. Erion himself was a great client and quite pleased with our work.</p></div>
            <div class="div26"><p>As mentioned before this is our client, Erion Kapaj, a Greek artist who graduated from Athens School of Fine Arts school and he currently teaches art students to prepare them for Art school. His passions include Sculpting, Painting, Building/ Handcrafting, photography and Mathematics. He captures scenes which sometimes include his handmade boats or other scenes from vacation or daily life and he paints them. These pieces can be found on his Saachi art page listed as not for sale. His signature style is painting with different shades of white to create misty images/ portraits.</p></div>
